# FinalWebDesignProject

This project was created at a high school (I am not going to reveal the name). It was created for my web design curriculum course.

If you want to see the final product, it is posted online at https://just-if-web-design-crashes--colefleming.repl.co/

For this project, I used CSS, HTML, JS, and Jquery.
